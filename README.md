# Evaluating Autoencoder-Driven Dimensionality Reduction for Bulk RNA-seq Clustering of Green Anole Skeletal Muscle

Abstract
This project examined whether a deep autoencoder embedding could improve clustering of bulk RNA-seq data from green anole muscle stem cells (MuSCs) relative to standard methods. Using features of mappability, read count, and RPKM for 14,283 genes, an autoencoder was trained, and its low-dimensional representation was compared to PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP for hierarchical clustering. 
Cluster quality was evaluated via silhouette and Calinski–Harabasz scores. The autoencoder achieved near-zero reconstruction loss and ~100% accuracy very rapidly, indicating that it effectively memorized the data without actual compression (as there were only three input features). In clustering, nonlinear methods outperformed PCA: UMAP yielded the highest silhouette (0.4045) and Calinski–Harabasz (8534.2) scores, followed by a combination of autoencoding + UMAP, then t-SNE. PCA and the autoencoder alone scored lower. 
These results suggest that nonlinear embeddings (especially UMAP) capture cluster structure in bulk RNA-seq more effectively than linear PCA or the autoencoder embedding, although the very low input dimensionality limited the autoencoder’s benefit. Future assessment of the autoencoder’s performance with access to a higher-dimension dataset is recommended.
